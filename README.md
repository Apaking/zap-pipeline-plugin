===
This is a Jenkins pipeline plugin that lets you control <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project">OWASP Zed Attack Proxy</a> through Jenkins Pipeline. Unlike the other plugins for ZAP, this generates a report independently which shows new alerts compared to the last build, has the ability to fail a build with user configurable failure parameters, filters out false positives (user configurable) andÂ displays a graph which shows the amount of ZAP alerts over your builds.

## Jenkinsfile Usage example
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages { 
        stage('Setup') {
            steps {
                script {
                    startZap(host: 127.0.0.1, port: 9091, timeout:500, zapHome: "/opt/zaproxy", sessionPath:"/somewhere/session.session", allowedHosts:['github.com']) // Start ZAP at /opt/zaproxy/zap.sh, allowing scans on github.com
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Build & Test') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh "mvn verify -Dhttp.proxyHost=127.0.0.1 -Dhttp.proxyPort=9091 -Dhttps.proxyHost=127.0.0.1 -Dhttps.proxyPort=9091" // Proxy tests through ZAP
                }
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            script {
                archiveZap(failAllAlerts: 1, failHighAlerts: 0, failMediumAlerts: 0, failLowAlerts: 0, falsePositivesFilePath: "zapFalsePositives.json")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This example is a declarative pipeline, but using the functions on a scripted pipeline works the same.

 
## API
**startZap** - Starts the ZAP process and configures the plugin. 
```groovy
startZap(host: 127.0.0.1, port: 9095, timeout: 900, failHighAlert:1, failLowAlert:10, zapHome: "/opt/zaproxy", allowedHosts:['10.0.0.1'], sessionPath:"/path/to/session.session")

host: The host to run the ZAP proxy server on. Passed to ZAP in the -host parameter.
port: The port to run the proxy on
timeout (optional): If a scan takes too long it will stop
failAllBuild (optional): Maximum amount of alerts that can happen in total before a build will fail
failHighBuild (optional): Maximum amount of high risk alerts that can happen before a build will fail
failMediumBuild (optional): Maximum amount of medium risk alerts that can happen before a build will fail
failLowBuild (optional): Maximum amount of low risk alerts that can happen before a build will fail
allowedHosts (optional): Once the active ZAP scan starts, it won't scan any hosts unless they are here. If you don't set this it will only scan if the host is localhost
sessionPath (optional): If you want to load a previous ZAP session that you have expored, you can do that here. Useful when you want to run a scan but don't want to run all your tests through ZAP.
```
<br>

**runZapCrawler** - Runs the ZAP crawler on a specific URL
```groovy
runZapCrawler(host: "https://localhost")
```

<br>

**importZapScanPolicy** - Loads a specific ZAP attack policy from the path you specify (Scan Policy Manager -> Export), to be used with runZapAttack

```groovy
importZapScanPolicy(policyPath: "/home/you/yourattackpolicy.policy")
```
<br>

**importZapUrls** - Imports a list of URLs to ZAP. You need the "Import files containing URLs" plugin for this to work.
```groovy
importZapUrls(path: "/path/to/your/urls")
```
<br>

**runZapAttack** - Once you have proxied your tests through ZAP or ran the crawler, this function runs an active scan on all the hosts that have been provided in the allowedHosts parameter in startZap.
```groovy
runZapAttack(userId: 5, scanPolicyName: "yourScanPolicy")

userId (optional): Run the scan with a specific user, loaded from the session
scanPolicyName (optional): The attack policy to use when running the scan. Loaded with importScanPolicy
```
<br>

**archiveZap** - Reads the alerts found by ZAP, filters out any false positives if a false positives file is provided in the project, checks if there are any alerts that are higher than the fail build parameters (and fails the build if so), generates a report, and finally shuts down ZAP. This should be the last thing you run.

```groovy
archiveZap(failAllAlerts: 1, failHighAlerts: 0, failMediumAlerts: 0, failLowAlerts: 0, falsePositivesFilePath: "zapFalsePositives.json")
```

## Proxying your tests
```groovy
sh "mvn verify -Dhttp.proxyHost=127.0.0.1 -Dhttp.proxyPort=9095 -Dhttps.proxyHost=127.0.0.1 -Dhttps.proxyPort=9095"
```

You may need to exclude some hosts from the proxy. If so use the -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts parameter, eg -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=*.com\\|*.co.uk

-----

## Proxying localhost
By default Java will not proxy localhost, 127.0.0.1, or any common loopback addresses. There is no way to disable this unless you set -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts= (empty). This means it's impossible to proxy just localhost without editing project code. You can mitigate this by changing your applications host to localhost.localdomain, which isn't checked by Java (NOTE: not all OS's have this hostname as a loopback address by default, you may need to add it to your machine's 'hosts' file).

-----

## Generating ZAP False Positives file
You can provide a JSON file of false positive definitions from your workspace to the zap plugin during the archive step (default is 'zapFalsePositives.json'). The file must consist of a single valid JSON array of 'False Positive' objects. Example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Cross Site Scripting (Reflected)",
    "cweid": "79",
    "wascid": "8",
    "uri": "https:\/\/yourdomain.com\/a\/certain\/url",
    "method": "POST",
    "param": "param1",
    "attack": "<script>alert(1);</script>",
    "evidence": "<script>alert(1);</script>"
  },
  {
    "uri": "https:\/\/yourdomain.com\/another/url",
    "method": "GET"
  }
]
```
All alert instances that match to a 'False Positive' object are ignored when judging whether to fail a build, and are initially hidden in the UI report. A match is when ALL fields provided in the False Positive object are equal to that in a given alert instance. It is best practice to be as specific as possible (to not hide future true positives that may occur).

To aid the generation of a false positives file, the UI report provides a 'Copy To Clipboard' button under each instance, that copies the alert instance as JSON, which can be used as a false positive object in the false positive file. 

The false positive URI is a regex string, alert instance URIs will be tested against this.
